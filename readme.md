## Reflection

**Mosaic layout**

Proved difficult to dynamically generate a mosaic layout

- Couldnt work using vanilla CSS and JS // tried a framework
  ended up scrapping a framework entirely and using columns to populate the area

**Panning wide images**

Changes to prototype

- scrapped filter feature - double checking the retrieved items were all in colour either way, proved redundant
- Changed way result value loading occurs (Went from adjusting how many results displayed in a page to the user just clicking more)
- couldn't figure out how to put the "explore the NFSA's collection" into the grid, added on top in desktop

Somewhat satisfied with final product, would have liked further
